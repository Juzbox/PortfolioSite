                    <p>Bring your own barricade was an informal project that emerged during the <a class="doc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests" target="_blank">CAA and CAB protests</a> in India. The idea was to explore how a ubiquitous symbol of crowd control, law enforcement, but also often neutral tool for traffic mitication could be reclaimed to voice the needs of citizens rather than that of the Delhi police. <br> <br>For this project I gave friends on social media a blank rendering of a barricade for them to express themselves under the banner of BYOB. This resulted in a unique collection of barricades which I hope one day I will get to bring to life in the physical world. Using these contributions I created a series of designs for alternative uses of barricades both as new means of policing or servicing the needs of protesters as they occupied the streets.<br> <br> I have been fascinated by barricades as a form of urban furniture ever since I arrived in India and had already made <a class="doc" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BfDOP-mFmiZ/" target="_blank">some artworks</a> around the topic. This short project also shows the natural progression from one exploration to the next linking the tools created for PS to the questions asked in Pijoon. </p>
