The idea was to explore how a ubiquitous symbol of crowd control, law enforcement, but also often neutral tool for traffic mitication could be reclaimed to voice the needs of citizens rather than that of the Delhi police. <br> <br>For this project I gave friends on social media a blank rendering of a barricade for them to express themselves under the banner of BYOB. This resulted in a unique collection of barricades which I hope one day I will get to bring to life in the physical world. Using these contributions I created a series of designs for alternative uses of barricades both as new means of policing or servicing the needs of protesters as they occupied the streets.<br> <br> I have been fascinated by barricades as a form of urban furniture ever since I arrived in India and had already made <a class="doc" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BfDOP-mFmiZ/" target="_blank">some artworks</a> around the topic. This short project also shows the natural progression from one exploration to the next linking the tools created for PS to the questions asked in Pijoon. </p>

                        The 2019 edition of Museomix in India was held at the Sanskriti Kendra Terracotta Museum. Teams were able to spend time in four carefully chosen rooms, each with their own unique artworks from different regions and traditions. The teams participating spent the first day or so learning about their respective spaces and artworks, deciphering them and drawing inspiration from them with the help of Mr.Dutt from the museum.

                        <br>The three days were packed with discussions, drafts of possible interventions, and intervention prototypes. The teams worked breathlessly to bring to life a new, personal, interpretation of the space they had adopted for the weekend.

                    <p><br><texti> Art Direction and Workshop Facilitation | Quicksand Design Studio </texti>Series of workshops on telling stories through virtual spaces. Both sessions were hosted with Salil Parehk, and paired narrative building with game design. The spaces and the navigation within them was first storyboarded then physically prototyped before being translated into digital assets using Unity.

                    I am a design researcher trying to make sense of the world we've built for ourselves while exploring alternative modes of living, earning, thinking, one project at a time.<br><br>

                    Design has given me an invaluable set of tools and processes that help ground conversations, prioritise needs and find solutions that translate constraints into inspritation. <br><br>

                    My work has enabled me to work between Los Angeles, Paris and Delhi for corporate and government actors engaging with a wide range of topics including access to clean energy, humanitarian aid, sexual and reproductive health, financial inclusion, and innovation at large.
                    <br><br>
                    Each engagement has taught me valuable lessons about the importance of regularly sharpening one's accountability, integrity, sensibility.
                    <br><br>
                    Through my work I hope to continue making tools not products, build bridges not walls, and support opensource culture.
